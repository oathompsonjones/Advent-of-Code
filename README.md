# Advent of Code
Who needs chocolate when you've got code?
~~Me, I do, you always need chocolate!~~

I started doing this in 2020, but stopped after day 17 (I can't remember why, I was probably either too busy, or on holiday).
I skipped 2021 and 2023 because I had too much uni work at the time, and in 2022 I stopped at day 16 (again, I can't remember why).
Here's hoping that I finish it in 2024.

Merry Christmas! 🎄🎁🎅
